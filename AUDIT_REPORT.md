# 🛡️ Kaizen-Sigma Quality Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** ❌ FAILED (Stop-the-Line Triggered)

## 📊 Statistical Summary

- **Measured Cpk**: 1.0543 (Target: >= 1.33)
- **Sigma Level**: ~3.16 Sigma
- **System Action**: Pipeline Terminated

## 🔄 Kaizen Progress (Continuous Improvement)

The methodology is currently tracking **150** simulated improvement events.

- **Muda Recovery**: Exponential decay modeling is active.
- **PCE % Statistics**: Baseline efficiency being established.

## 🚀 Corrective Actions (PDCA)

1. **Plan**: Analyze the 1.05 Cpk failure. The current Standard Deviation is too high for the 1.33 Cpk threshold.
2. **Do**: Refactor data generation to tighten variance or adjust specification limits.
3. **Check**: Re-run `gatekeeper.py` to verify if Cpk >= 1.33.
4. **Act**: Update `methodology/standard_work/process_standards.md` if the new stability point is achieved.
